### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the effectiveness and resistance status of different antibiotics prescribed for various medical conditions. 
The dataset includes patient demographics, antibiotic types, dosages, frequencies, treatment durations, and effectiveness ratings.

### Data Sources
Antibiotics Resistance Data: The primary data set used for this analysis is [Download.here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brNbzJGz1cYkGqLkZ7smNOAfbdtDuAzW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103781266360086393532&rtpof=true&sd=true) about antibiotics used in hospitals.

### Analysis and Findings

The dataset reveals key insights into antibiotic prescriptions, effectiveness, and resistance trends. **Azithromycin** is the most prescribed antibiotic, followed closely by **Metronidazole** and **Doxycycline**. However, **Metronidazole** has the highest resistance rate, while **Azithromycin** shows minimal resistance.  

Effectiveness ratings are fairly similar across antibiotics, with **Amoxicillin** having the highest average dosage but the lowest effectiveness. **Ciprofloxacin** has the highest cost per day at **$6.5**, while **Azithromycin** is the cheapest at **$5.6**.  

Among genotypes, **AA (293 cases) and AS (300 cases)** show the most resistance, highlighting a potential genetic factor in antibiotic resistance. These findings suggest the need for alternative treatments for resistant genotypes and cost-effective antibiotic prescriptions. 

### Recommendation
 
- Promote Effective Antibiotics: Prioritize Azithromycin and Doxycycline for sensitive cases.  
- Reduce Resistance: Enforce stricter prescription guidelines.  
- Cost-Effectiveness: Optimize Ciprofloxacin for specific infections.  
- Genotype-Based Treatment: Prescribe Azithromycin for Genotype AS cases.  
- Prevent Misuse: Monitor Azithromycin to avoid resistance buildup.  
- Precision Treatment: Conduct culture & sensitivity tests before prescribing.
